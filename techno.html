    *Environment is living things and what is around them. 

    *It can be living or non-living things.

    *It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces.

    *Living things do not simply exist in their environment.

    *They constantly interact with it. Organisms change in response to conditions in their environment.

    *In the environment there are interactions between plants, animals, soil, water, temperature.

<h4>WELCOME</h4>
  In biology and ecology, the environment is all of the natural materials and living things, including sunlight. 
  This is also called the natural environment. Some people call themselves environmentalists. They think we must protect the environment, 
  to keep it safe.  Things in the natural environment that we value are called natural resources. For example; fish, sunlight, and forests. 

 These are renewable resources because they come back naturally when we use them. Non-renewable resources are important things in the environment
 that are limited  for example, ores and fossil fuels. Some things in the natural environment can kill people, such as lightning.

 Environment is defined as the total planetary inheritance and the totality of all resources.It includes all the biotic and abiotic
 factors that influence each other.While all living elements- 

 The birds,animals,plants,fisheries etc.-are biotic elements, abiotic elements include air,water,sunlight etc. A study of the environment 
 then calls for a study of the inter-relationship between these  biotic and abiotic components of the environment.
